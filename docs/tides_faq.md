# 🌀 TIDES FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

## What is TIDES?

**TIDES (Time-based Incentivized Distribution of Earnings System)** is TAOHash's Bitcoin reward distribution protocol.  
It’s inspired by OCEAN’s Transparent Index of Distinct Extended Shares — a provably fair, variance-smoothing reward system that tracks every submitted share in order, calculates its value within a moving reward *window*, and distributes BTC accordingly.  

TIDES ensures that:
- Every miner receives **direct Bitcoin payouts** proportional to their verified share contributions.
- The system is **transparent and auditable**, meaning rewards can be verified from public share logs.
- Consistent miners earn **stable, predictable payouts** over time — no “pool hopping” or luck bias.

Registering your wallet on **Bittensor Subnet 14** unlocks an **additional 5% Alpha Token reward** based on your hashrate contribution.

## Do I need to join Bittensor to earn TIDES rewards?

**No!**  
TIDES BTC rewards are open to all miners connected to TAOHash — no Bittensor registration is required.  
Simply point your miner to the TAOHash Stratum endpoint, configure your payout address, and start earning.

## How does the reward system work?

TAOHash operates with **two parallel incentive systems**:

1. **TIDES BTC Rewards (All Miners)**  
   - Paid directly in Bitcoin.  
   - Based on your share contributions within the active TIDES window.  
   - Transparent and non-custodial — rewards are tied directly to block discovery.  

2. **Alpha Token Rewards (Bittensor Registered Miners)**  
   - +5% additional value relative to your hashrate.  
   - Denominated in Alpha Tokens (convertible to TAO).  
   - Encourages participation in Bittensor’s decentralized compute network.
