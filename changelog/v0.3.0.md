# v0.3.0 — TIDES Protocol Release

## 🌊 Overview

**TIDES (Time-based Incentivized Distribution of Earnings System)** is now **live** on TAOHash — marking the launch of our fully transparent, dual-reward Bitcoin distribution protocol.

This release introduces a *provably fair*, variance-smoothing reward system inspired by OCEAN’s TIDES architecture. It ensures that all miners, whether registered on Bittensor or not, receive rewards proportional to their verified computational contributions.

## Dual Reward Architecture

TAOHash now operates two parallel, independently managed reward streams:

### 1. TIDES BTC Protocol (Open to All Miners)

- **Open Access:** Available to **any miner** contributing hashpower to TAOHash — no registration or staking required.  
- **Fair Distribution:** BTC rewards are allocated **proportionally** to each miner’s share difficulty inside the **TIDES Window**.  
- **Sliding Window Model:**  
  - The window size dynamically equals `network_difficulty × 8`, roughly representing the last eight blocks of work.  
  - As new shares arrive, the window slides forward, keeping total share difficulty ≤ this threshold.  
  - This mechanism smooths variance and prevents “pool-hopping” exploitation.  
- **Transparent Accounting:** Every share is recorded in an ordered, immutable log. Reward splits can be independently verified.  
- **Direct Payouts:** BTC is automatically distributed to the **address in your mining username**, via on-chain or Lightning payouts.

### 2. Alpha Token Incentives (Bittensor-Registered Miners)

- **+5% Value Back:** Registered miners on **Subnet 14** receive an additional incentive worth **5% of their contributed hashpower value**.  
- **Calculated via Hashprice Index:** The bonus is derived using real-time Bitcoin hashprice and exchange rate data.  
- **Ecosystem Alignment:** Alpha tokens are convertible to TAO based on the current exchange rate. 
- **Total Return:** TIDES BTC rewards + 5% Alpha Token bonus for registered miners.

## Validator & Infrastructure Updates

- **Validator Deployment:**  
  The validator infrastructure supporting Alpha rewards is fully operational. Validators continuously track miner shares, and compute Alpha rewards.

- **Data Integrity:**  
  Each submitted share is indexed and timestamped. Older shares are never removed from the share-log history.

- **Modular Emission Engine:**  
  Alpha token emissions are dynamically generated & payed out based on verified share difficulty. The disbursements follow a form of Pay per Share (PPS) with the value being 5% of the total hashpower provided.
